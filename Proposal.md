# Employee Engagement Platform

Employee Engagement Platform gives you visibility into the health of your organization and guides effective action. 

Employee Engagement Platform's (name tbd) purpose is to gauge the level of employee happiness within companies of 50 employees or under. 

Employees have the ability to voice concerns/suggestions anonymously or with their names attached. Suggestions can be voted on/agreed on by other employees if they feel similarly.

Employers can also ask for employee feedback on anything. For example, it can be used to vote on company-wide events, outings, etc.

1. Suggestion Box - Anonymous & non-anonymous. Allow employees/users vote up suggestions they agree with.
2. Polling employees - Get real-time responses on what to do as a company. It can be used for company-wide events, outings, etc.
3. API - we are going to use an API that will give our users/"employees" a list of local deals/coupons to use around town as a form of incentive.
