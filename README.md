# E.E.P - The Employee Engagement Dashboard

E.E.P is a way for employers with up to 50 employees get feedback from their team. There are several sections: a dashboard with a calendar of company events, a suggestion box, a weekly survey, and rewards that act as employee incentives.

In order to login, install the application and use one of the credentials below. They are stored in the users file in the /db/ directory.
